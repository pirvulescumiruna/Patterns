E-LEARNING WEB PLATFORM FOR UNIVERSITIES

The app allows creation of different types of reports, individual for each student or collective for an entire group of students.
An effective solution must be found to be able to create both individual or collective reports for users.

Pros
-avoiding tight coupling between creator and concrete reports
-you are able to introduce new types of reports into the program without breaking existing client code

Cons
-code complexity increases as you may need to introduce a lot of new subclasses to implement the pattern
-loose coupling results in decreseased performance
