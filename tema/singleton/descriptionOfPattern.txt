E-LEARNING WEB PLATFORM FOR UNIVERSITIES

There is a need to track any changes that are made regarding assignments for students. For that a logger must be implemented in order
to be able to track the changes into a single log file.

Pros
-you can be sure that a class has only a single instance.
-the logger is initialized only when itâ€™s requested the first time.

Cons
-the pattern solves two problems at the time, which is bad clean code design (SRP)
-difficult to unit test since most frameworks use mocks
